<H3>A compilation of records associated with the Jarvis family in Australia</H3>
<br>

<p style="background: Gainsboro; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
These pages will lead you to records associated with the Jarvis family in Adelaide, South Australia - Keith Scott Jarvis and Shirley Mary Sanderson. Keith's parents (Eric Roy and Alice May) lead to the Jarvis and Scott families of Adelaide and Victor Harbor, and Shirley's parents (Verner and Gertrude) lead to the Sandersons and Spurlings of Port Augusta. See the Scott and Sanderson families below.

<h3>The family pages</h3>

<p style="background: palegoldenrod; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">

<br>
<a href="https://jarvis-genealogy.github.io/Jarvis-Family/" target="blank"><b>The Jarvis family</b></a>
<br><br>
This describes the Jarvis family in Adelaide, South Australia and includes a descendency chart, documents, a photo album, references and other material of interest. Naturally the tree expands enormously and is not limited to the information here. Much more can and will be added. 
<br><br>

<a href="https://jarvis-genealogy.github.io/Jarvis-Family/content/scott-tree.html" target="blank"><b>The Scott family</b></a>
<br><br>
The Jarvis family is linked to the Scott family through Alice May Scott who married Eric Roy Jarvis. Alice is grandmother to the author and many memories of Uncles and Aunts are from the Scott family. The descendency chart gives an overview of the connection. 
<br><br>

<a href="#Image_galleries"><b>The Desmond family</b></a>

<br><br>
Alice&apos;s brother, Arnold, married Violet Moon and their daughter, Norma, married Ray Desmond which leads Desmond family. Three image albums have been created from <a href="#Image_galleries">photos</a> provided by Greg Desmond.
<br><br>

<a href="https://jarvis-genealogy.github.io/Quintrell-Family/" target="blank"><b>The Quintrell family</b></a>
<br><br>
Alice&apos;s sister, Olive, married Norman Quintrell and this leads to the Quintrell family covered in detail by Neil Quintrell. His family website contains a huge amount of information for the descendants of the Scott and Quintrell families as well as the Jarvis family of Alice May and Eric Roy Jarvis.
<br><br>

<a href="https://jarvis-genealogy.github.io/Sanderson-Family/" target="blank"><b>The Sanderson family</b></a>
<br><br>
This provides information for the descendants of Verner Stuart Leslie Sanderson and Gertrude Spurling of Port Augusta. Verner and Gertrude are parents of Shirley Mary Sanderson who married Keith Scott Jarvis in 1949.
<br><br>

<a href="https://jarvis-genealogy.github.io/Sanderson-Diary/" target="blank"><b>The Sanderson diary</b></a>
<br><br>
This is a record of the diary of Verner Stuart Leslie Sanderson, father of Shirley Mary Sanderson, describing his experiences in the first World War from the period July 17th 1915 to August 3rd 1917.
<br><br>
He was in signals and was responsible for maintaining communications, whatever that night have entailed. We can only imagine what that might have been, but can get some idea from the diary.
<br><br>
Not only is the hand-written diary transcribed, but it's extended with batallion daily extracts, maps, images, videos and links to more information. You can spend much time exploring this diary and hopefully understand what it was like from the words of somebody who was there at the time.
<br><br>
It's a small blue booklet that the author must have carried with him in his pocket in the trenches. He must have added to it day by day with the thought that one day somebody would read it. Now we all can.

<b>GitHub</b>
<br><br>
<a href = "https://github.com/" target="blank">GitHub</a> is a hosting site for repositories where developers and programmers can upload code and work on it collaboratively. This web-page is itself a programming project using <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="blank">html</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="blank">css</a>. It's part of a GitHub account containing the <a href = "https://github.com/jarvis-genealogy" target="blank">individual repositories</a>. As well as viewing the web pages from here, you can download them complete to save and explore the various folders, files and images. To do that, just click on the individual repository, for example the <a href="https://github.com/jarvis-genealogy/Jarvis-Family">Jarvis family</a>, click on the green &quot;Code&quot; button and &quot;Download zip&quot;.
<br><br>

<b>Family record</b>
<br><br>
I wanted to create a lasting family record independent of any Geneaology or web hosting service or even software to generate the pages. Here, the source files are basic html and the web-pages are generated and hosted directly by GitHub.
<br><br>
The downside is that the pages have a plain look, the descendancy charts do not offer all the features of Geneaology services. But you don't have to sign up for anything and there is full public access. Multiple authors ensure that the record is never lost and will last as long as GitHub and the use of html.
<br><br>

<b>Other sources</b>
<br><br>
Links to pages generated by other services as well as other families will be included here, as well as any additional material of interest.
