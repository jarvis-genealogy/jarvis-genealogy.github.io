<H3>A compilation of records associated with the Jarvis family in Australia</H3>
<br>

<p style="background: Gainsboro; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
These pages will lead you to records associated with the Jarvis family in Adelaide, South Australia - Keith Scott Jarvis and Shirley Mary Sanderson. Keith's parents (Eric Roy and Alice May) lead to the Jarvis and Scott families of Adelaide and Victor Harbor, and Shirley's parents (Verner and Gertrude) lead to the Sandersons and Spurlings of Port Augusta. See the Sanderson Family below.

<h3>The family pages</h3>

<p style="background: palegoldenrod; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">

<br>
<a href="https://jarvis-genealogy.github.io/Jarvis-Family/" target="blank"><b>The Jarvis family</b></a>
<br><br>
This describes the Jarvis family in Adelaide, South Australia and includes a descendency chart, documents, a photo album, references and other material of interest. Naturally the tree expands enormously and is not limited to the information here. Much more can and will be added. 
<br><br>

<a href="https://jarvis-genealogy.github.io/Quintrell-Family/" target="blank"><b>The Quintrell family</b></a>
<br><br>
This contains the work of Neil Quintrell who's mother Olive was sister to my grandmother Alice. His family website contains a huge amount of information for the descendants of the Scott and Quintrell families as well as the Jarvis family of Alice May and Eric Roy Jarvis.
<br><br>
<a href="https://jarvis-genealogy.github.io/Sanderson-Family/" target="blank"><b>The Sanderson family</b></a>
<br><br>
This provides information for the descendants of Verner Stuart Leslie Sanderson and Gertrude Spurling of Port Augusta. Verner and Gertrude are parents of Shirley Mary Sanderson who married Keith Scott Jarvis in 1949.
<br><br>
<a href="https://jarvis-genealogy.github.io/Sanderson-Diary/" target="blank"><b>The Sanderson diary</b></a>
<br><br>
This is a record of the diary of Verner Stuart Leslie Sanderson, father of Shirley Mary Sanderson, describing his experiences in the first World War from the period July 17th 1915 to August 3rd 1917.
<br><br>
He was in signals and was responsible for maintaining communications, whatever that night have entailed. We can only imagine what that might have been, but can get some idea from the diary.
<br><br>
Not only is the hand-written diary transcribed, but it's extended with batallion daily extracts, maps, images, videos and links to more information. You can spend much time exploring this diary and hopefully understand what it was like from the words of somebody who was there at the time.
<br><br>
It's a small blue booklet that the author must have carried with him in his pocket in the trenches. He must have added to it day by day with the thought that one day somebody would read it. Now we all can.

<h3>Family history archive</h3>

<p style="background: palegoldenrod; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
<br>
Why GitHub?<br><br>
<a href = "https://github.com/" target="blank">GitHub</a> is a hosting site for repositories where developers and programmers can upload code and work on it collaboratively. The version control system allows any changes to be traced. Projects are open-source and can be made open to the public. This web-page is itself a programming project using <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="blank">html</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="blank">css</a>. It's part of a GitHub account <a href = "https://github.com/jarvis-genealogy" target="blank">containing the individual repositories</a>. As well as viewing the web pages from here, you can download them complete or explore the various folders, files and images.
<br><br>

Why bother?
<br><br>
I wanted to create an open-source record independent of any service, paid or otherwise, either for creating a Family Tree or simply hosting a web-site. The reason is simple. If a paid subscription expires, so can the record. Even if the hosting service is free of charge, the record can be lost if the service is changed or no longer available. The same problem exists if other software is used to create the pages. Here the pages are self-contained and because web-pages can be generated and hosted by GitHub, a separate hosting service is not necessary.
<br><br>

Pros and cons
<br><br>
The downside is that the pages have a plain look, the descendancy charts do not offer all the features of hosted services and it's not as simple to create and maintain. But you don't have to sign up for anything and there is full public access. Multiple authors ensure that the record is never lost. It will last as long as GitHub itself and the use of html.
<br><br>

Other sources
<br><br>
Of course this archive does not exclude pages generated by other services. Links to them as well as other families can be included here, as well as any additional material of interest.
