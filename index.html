<H3>A compilation of records associated with the Jarvis family in Australia</H3>
<br>

<p style="background: Gainsboro; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
This page will lead you to records associated with the Jarvis family in Adelaide, South Australia - Keith Jarvis and Shirley Mary Sanderson. Keith's parents lead to the Jarvis and Scott families of Adelaide and Victor Harbor, and Shirley's parents lead to the Sandersons and Spurlings of Port Augusta. Each family page contains a descendency chart, documents, a photo album, references and other material of interest. Naturally the tree expands enormously and is not limited to the information here. Much more can and will be added.

<p style="background: palegoldenrod; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
<br><br>
Why GitHub?<br><br>
<a href = "https://github.com/" target="blank">GitHub</a> is a hosting site for repositories where developers and programmers can upload code and work on it collaboratively. The version control system allows any changes to be traced. Projects are open-source and can be made open to the public. This web-page is itself a programming project using <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="blank">html</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="blank">css</a>. You can download it complete or explore the various folders, files and images. Web-pages can also be generated and hosted by GitHub so that a separate hosting service is not necessary.
<br><br>

Why bother?
<br><br>
I wanted to create an open-source record independent of any service, paid or otherwise, either for creating a Family Tree or simply hosting a web-site. The reason is simple. If a paid subscription expires, so can the record. Even if the hosting service is free, the record can be lost if the service is changed or no longer available. The same problem exists if other software is used to create the pages.
<br><br>

Pros and cons
<br><br>
The downside is that the pages have a plain look, the descendancy charts do not offer all the features of hosted services and it's not as simple to create and maintain. But you don't have to sign up for anything and the pages are self-contained. Public access to the source and multiple authors ensure that the record is never lost and will last as long as GitHub itself and the use of html.
<br><br>

Other sources
<br><br>
Of course this archive does not exclude pages generated by other services. Links to them as well as other families can be included here, as well as any additional material of interest.
